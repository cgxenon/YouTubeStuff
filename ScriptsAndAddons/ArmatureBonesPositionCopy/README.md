The script matches bones by name and sets it position in other armature.

It operates based on standard batch processing, following the principle of moving the cursor to the root of the selected bone and placing the target armature's bone body at the cursor's location. This helps to maintain the orientation of the bones, which is useful when working with the Unreal Engine and other software.
